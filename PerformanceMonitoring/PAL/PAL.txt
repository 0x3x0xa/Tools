v2.3.2

    Bug Fix: Some of the counter instances were missing in the charts. Fixed.
    Report change: All of the counter instances are now sorted alphabetically.
    Report change: The "Global" counter instances in the .NET CLR counter objects are moved to their own chart similar to the "_Total" counter instances.
    Bug Fix: The Y axis labels for the Avg. Disk sec/Read and Avg. Disk Sec/Write performance counters were blank when doing a multi-threaded analysis. This has been fixed.
