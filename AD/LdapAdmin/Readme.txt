What is LDAP Admin?

Ldap Admin is a free Windows LDAP client and administration tool for LDAP directory management. This application lets you browse, search, modify, create and delete objects on LDAP server. It also supports more complex operations such as directory copy and move between remote servers and extends the common edit functions to support specific object types (such as groups and accounts).
