== MSOnline Manage Sway / Office 365 Services ==

The script offers functionality to manage Microsoft® Office 365 services.

Its main purpose was to disable or enable (show/hide) the Microsoft® Sway tile on the app launcher of the Microsoft® Office 365 portal, but it can also be used to manage any other Microsoft® Office 365 service.
