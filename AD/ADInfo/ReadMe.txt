== AD INFO - ACTIVE DIRECTORY REPORTING TOOL ==

A flexible Active Directory reporting tool with over 190 built in reports as well as the option to create your own 
With more flexability than other Active Directory reporting tools and a modern user friendly interface, AD Info lets you easily query your Active Directory domain for the information you need. Use one of the 190+ queries that come with the application or use the custom query designer to create your own query based on any attributes you choose.

Free Edition 
The free edition is provided in the hope that it is useful to fellow IT Pros, it is not intended to just be a trial/demo of the standard edition (though you can use it as such if you are considering purchasing the standard edition). Whilst some features are only available in the standard edition, hopefully the fact that it still has over 190 predefined queries and can export results to CSV will mean it is the most useful free active directory reporting tool around. See below for a summary of the features that can be found in the free edition (and the standard edition)

Powerful - Query a huge number of attributes on Computers, Contacts, Containers/OUs, Groups, GPOs, Printers, and Users 
Fast - Retrieving only the attributes you are interested in and using intelligent caching helps make this one of the fastest AD reporting tools available 
Useful - Easily query several attributes that are not included in many other similar tools, such as direct and nested group membership 
Accurate - AD Info will query each DC in the domain to get accurate values for any non-replicated attributes (Last Logon etc) 
User Friendly - Designed to be easy to use and modern, you can be running your first query within seconds of launching AD Info for the first time 
Flexible - Enter your own values. For example instead of a query such as "Members of Domain Admins", AD Info lets you specify any group (see screenshots) 
Secure - AD Info does not require Domain Admin permissions so you do not need to log on as an Administrator account to use it 
Exportable - Export any query results to CSV file for use in other processes and reports 
Multi-Domain Friendly - Easily query any domain you have access to. Enter a domain name and credentials, then any queries you run will target this domain
