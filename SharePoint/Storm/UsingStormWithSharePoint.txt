## How to use the  WSDL (Web Services Description Language) in SharePoint with Storm ##

1. Locate the 'SharePointWebServices.stormproj' project file in this directory. This file already contains references to most of the MOSS 2007 and SharePoint Server 2010 Web Services.

2. Make a copy of the 'SharePointWebServices.stormproj' file and rename it to a .stormproj file of your choice.

3. Open the copy of your Storm project file with a test editor of your choice and do a find and replace:

-- Find: http://YourWebApplication.com
-- Replace: The URL of your SharePoint web application

4. Save the changes you made to the Storm project file.

5. Open up Storm by running the 'Storm.exe' file.

6. Select the 'Open' icon to 'open storm project' and navigate to your Storm project file.

7. You should now be able to launch all the WSDL references for your SharePoint web application.


## Adding additional WSDL Services ##

The following 2 locations are good references to see what available Web Services are installed on your Farm:

-- MOSS 2007: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\ISAPI
-- SP2010: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\14\ISAPI
