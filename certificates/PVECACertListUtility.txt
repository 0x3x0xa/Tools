         This option requires a valid config file. By default, the

         This file must contain the following entries :
             mailserver=<hostname or IP of mailserver>
             mailserverport=<port to connect to on mailserver
             mailfrom=<email address>
             mailto=<email address>
         You can specify multiple To: addresses by separating the
         addresses with a comma
   -c <path to custom smtp config file>   This parameter allows you
         to specify the path/filename to a custom smtp config file
   -o    Only send email when action is required. Used only with -n
   -f <path to report file>   Use this parameter to specify a path/filename
         where the utility output report needs to be written to
         If this parameter is not used, the report will be written into
         a file called report.txt in the working directory
   -b    Don't write anything to log/report files
   -win2k3   Run application in older xp/win2k3 mode (no spaces in column names)
   -u    Check for updates)

Usage Example:

.\pveCACertList.exe -e 30 -v -n -o #Find all certs expiring within the next 30 days (-e), with Verbose output display (-v), Email notification with the report (-n), and only send email if action is required (-o)

Note: A 'report' text file is written to the same location where the utility is run from unless otherwise specified with the -f <path to report file> parameter
