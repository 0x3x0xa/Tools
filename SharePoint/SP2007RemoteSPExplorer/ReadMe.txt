SPElements Remote Explorer for SharePoint is a free utility that allows administrators (and power users) to browse Microsoft SharePoint internals without running any application on the SharePoint server. Remote Explorer uses SharePoint standard Web Services to access the data so there's no need to install anything on the SharePoint server.

- Sites.
- Site objects: alerts, content types, fields, lists & list templates.
- List objects: items, folders & item versions.
- Security objects: groups, users & roles.
- No installation required (single executable file).
- FREE.

Requeriments:

Server: Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 (WSS 3.0, SharePoint 2007, SharePoint Live)

Client: .NET Framework 2.0

Privileges: same as SharePoint designer (requires access to SharePoint remote interfaces).
