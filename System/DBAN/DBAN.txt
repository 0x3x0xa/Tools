Data Wiping Software

DBAN is free erasure software designed for the personal user. It automatically deletes the contents of any hard disk that it can detect. This method prevents identity theft before recycling a computer. DBAN is also a commonly used solution to remove viruses and spyware from Microsoft Windows installations.

DBAN users should be aware of some product limitations, including:

No guarantee of data removal (e.g. DBAN does not detect or securely erase SSDs)
No audit-ready reporting for regulatory compliance
Limited hardware support (e.g. no RAID dismantling)
No customer support or regular software updates
