UPDATE: Release 2.8 beta released 07 April 2010 with source code - see Release 2.8 beta page for release notes. Note also that this has now become the default release - previous reviews and download stats can be found under older releases.

NOTE: All versions of this tool work with SharePoint 2010 though you must edit a file (one time) to do this - see notes on version 2.8 page (linked above). Also note that v2.8 (or later) provides the best install experience on 2010
