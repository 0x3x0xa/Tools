Sysinternals Live Sync Tool

This little tool is a Windows application that runs in the background and syncs all the Sysinternal tools from the Microsoft servers to a folder on your local machine. You can add this tool to your Startup items and have it run whenever you start your machine to always be in sync with the latest tools.

How it works:

When the Sysinternals Live Sync Tool is started it will immediatley start to check that you have the latest Sysinternal tools downloaded. You can always make a manual check by right-clicking the Sysinternals Live Sync Tool icon in the Notification Area and choose Sync. Every hour it will try to download the latest info.

How to configure it:

The first time you start the Sysinternals Live Sync Tool you will not download the latest tools. You must first configure the target location of the tools. This is done by right-clicking the Sysinternals Live Sync Tool icon in the Notification Area and choose Settings. In the dialog specify the folder of your choice.
