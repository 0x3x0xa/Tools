Exclaimer Outlook Photos is a fully free product. There's no requirement to license it and we withhold no functionality from the product you download – it's not a free version of the product: the only version is always free.

In Outlook - Users and groups can get photo portraits in the Outlook Social Connector (sometimes called the Outlook People Pane) in seconds.
In SharePoint - SharePoint doesn't use the same Active Directory photo field as Outlook – but we support them all, so you can still see each user's portrait in Microsoft's essential collaboration tool.
In Lync - Give Microsoft's fastest growing unified communication platform a social spin too – with photos next to the user's name in conversations and next to their entry in the contacts list.
Auto-Match - A 'KarenGreen.jpg' would automatically match to Karen Green's profile, for example, or you can match based on other Active Directory data, not just names – like employee IDs.
Batch-Import - Whether it's a network folder, flash drive or some other container – we'll grab all your files in one swoop and add them to the Active Directory.
No Changes Required - Outlook Photos is simply an import tool – we've packed in all kinds of capabilities and functionality we think you'll need, but we never ask you to make adjustments to Exchange, Outlook or any of your resources.
