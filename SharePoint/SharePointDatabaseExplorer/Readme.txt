== SharePoint Database Explorer ==

Project Description

Designed to display, search and retrieve information from a SharePoint 2010 or 2013 database you can easily recover documents, including metadata, and export list items to Excel. 

Originally designed for disaster recovery purposes, all you need is the connection string information to the restored SharePoint content database.  The easy to use tree structure will allow you to navigate all sites, sub sites and lists or libraries within them.

SharePoint doesn't need to be installed to retrieve information since the application goes directly against the SQL Server content database.  Simply restore your content database to any SQL Server and then connect to browse the contents of that database.

Features supported:

Connect to any SharePoint 2010 or 2013 content database.
View all SharePoint objects (lists, libraries, sites, subsites etc).
Specify search criteria based on metadata to narrow your result set.
View all metadata based on the search criteria that is defined.
View and download all versions of a document.
Download all metadata to Excel.
